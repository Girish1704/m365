# Unlock AI Powered Future Work with Microsoft 365 Copilot + Agents

## Overall Estimated Duration: 3 Days (4 Hours/Day)

## Overview

Microsoft 365 Copilot is an AI-powered productivity tool that uses large language models (LLMs) and integrates your data with the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 Apps. In this hands-on lab, you will learn how Copilot provides real-time intelligent assistance, enabling users to enhance their creativity, productivity, and skills.

You will explore pre-built agents like Analyst, Researcher, and Document Analyzer, learn to create custom agents in SharePoint, build advanced agents with Microsoft Copilot Studio, and develop declarative agents using the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Use the Analyst Agent for data storytelling and insights
- Leverage the Researcher Agent for content organization and professional outputs
- Utilize the Document Analyzer Agent for document analysis in Word
- Create and configure Copilot Agents for knowledge assistance
- Build SharePoint agents for contextual answers
- Extend Microsoft 365 Copilot with custom agents using Copilot Studio
- Develop declarative agents using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit
- Build autonomous agents and implement agent flows
- Create prompt actions for dynamic content generation

## Pre-requisites

- Basic understanding of Microsoft 365 applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams)
- Familiarity with SharePoint Online
- Basic knowledge of AI concepts and natural language processing
- Understanding of business workflows and automation concepts

## Architecture

The lab environment consists of the following components:

- Microsoft 365 Tenant with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses
- Microsoft Copilot Studio for building custom agents
- Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (VS Code extension) for declarative agent development
- SharePoint Online for creating SharePoint-based agents
