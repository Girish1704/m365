# Exercise 2: Resolving Leadership Misalignment with Microsoft Copilot

#### Estimated Duration: 15 Minutes

### Overview
In this exercise, participants will step into the role of Transformation Lead supporting CFO Adrian Wells in resolving delays stemming from leadership misalignment. Using Microsoft Teams Copilot and Outlook Copilot, they will identify communication gaps, extract key themes from recent leadership meetings, and translate discussions into structured, actionable plans. The Transformation Lead will serve as the strategic facilitator, pinpointing diverging perspectives among executives, aligning priorities, assigning clear responsibilities and deadlines, and drafting follow-up communications that promote accountability and shared ownership. This hands-on scenario emphasizes strategic cohesion, operational momentum, and more effective cross-leadership collaboration by harnessing the full potential of Copilot tools.

### Review

This exercise guides participants through identifying and addressing leadership misalignment using Microsoft 365 Copilot tools. By analyzing pain points such as unclear discussions and a lack of follow-up, participants use Teams Copilot to summarize a leadership sync and extract actionable insights. They then leverage Outlook Copilot to draft a follow-up email that outlines key decisions, unresolved issues, and timelines. The outcome is a more aligned leadership team, with clearer communication and faster, more effective decision-making.
