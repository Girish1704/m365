# IT Support Copilot with Microsoft Copilot Studio

Welcome to the IT Support Copilot Hack in a Day! Today, you'll learn how to build an intelligent, conversational AI assistant that helps employees resolve common IT support issues instantly. Through this hands-on experience, you'll create a copilot that answers questions from knowledge base documents, guides users through troubleshooting steps, and automatically sends resolution summaries to your IT team.

## Scenario

A growing organization is overwhelmed with recurring IT support tickets such as password resets, VPN connectivity issues, hardware problems (laptops, printers, monitors, keyboards), and connectivity troubleshooting. The helpdesk team is spending most of its time solving repeat requests instead of focusing on critical incidents and escalations. To reduce ticket volume and provide 24/7 assistance, the company decides to build an IT Support Copilot that can answer support questions using IT knowledge base documents, guide users through troubleshooting steps, and automatically create Freshdesk tickets when escalation is required. This ensures faster issue resolution, happier employees, and reduced workload on IT support staff.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an IT Support Copilot that dramatically reduces the workload on your helpdesk by handling the most common support requests: credential resets, VPN connectivity issues, and hardware problems (laptops, printers, monitors, keyboards). Using Microsoft Copilot Studio's no-code platform, you'll build a conversational AI that leverages generative AI to provide accurate troubleshooting guidance, and integrates with Freshdesk to automatically create support tickets when escalation is needed.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Create and configure an IT Support Copilot from scratch in Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Upload and manage IT knowledge base documents (IT_Support_QA.pdf) for AI-powered question answering
- Set up Freshdesk account and obtain API credentials for external integration
- Create agent flows within Copilot Studio to integrate with Freshdesk API
- Use generative AI to create conversational topics with troubleshooting flows
- Map topic variables to flow inputs for dynamic ticket creation
- Test end-to-end integration from copilot to Freshdesk
- Deploy your copilot to Microsoft Teams for organization-wide access
- Implement best practices for IT support automation and user experience

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through six progressive stages that build a complete IT Support Copilot. Each challenge focuses on a key capability:

- **Challenge 1: Create IT Support Copilot in Copilot Studio** – Set up Copilot Studio, create your IT Support Copilot, configure instructions, and upload IT_Support_QA.pdf knowledge base
- **Challenge 2: Setup Freshdesk & Get API Credentials** – Activate Freshdesk free trial, configure account, and obtain API Key and Account URL for integration
- **Challenge 3: Create Freshdesk Ticket Flow** – Build an agent flow within Copilot Studio that connects to Freshdesk API for automated ticket creation
- **Challenge 4: Create Topics Using Generative AI** – Use AI to generate 3 conversational topics (CredentialResetSupport, VPNConnectivitySupport, HardwareSupportAssistant) and connect them to Freshdesk flow
- **Challenge 5: Test Your IT Support Copilot End-to-End** – Thoroughly test all topics, verify Freshdesk integration, and validate ticket creation
- **Challenge 6: Publish Your Copilot to Microsoft Teams** – Deploy copilot to Teams for organization-wide access and test complete user experience

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Build practical, real-world IT support automation capabilities
- Learn through hands-on configuration with Copilot Studio and Freshdesk
- See immediate results as tickets are created in Freshdesk
- Create a production-ready IT support solution with external API integration

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with creating a new IT Support Copilot in Microsoft Copilot Studio, configuring detailed instructions for IT support behavior, and uploading the IT_Support_QA.pdf knowledge base for intelligent responses.

Next, you'll set up a Freshdesk account and obtain the API credentials needed for external integration. You'll then create an agent flow within Copilot Studio (not external Power Automate) that connects to the Freshdesk API for automated ticket creation.

You'll use generative AI to create three interactive conversational topics that guide users through common IT issues: CredentialResetSupport (password resets and account lockouts), VPNConnectivitySupport (VPN and connectivity troubleshooting), and HardwareSupportAssistant (laptop, printer, monitor, keyboard, and other device issues). Each topic will provide self-service troubleshooting steps from the knowledge base and escalate to Freshdesk ticket creation when needed.

Finally, you'll thoroughly test the complete solution and deploy it to Microsoft Teams for organization-wide access. By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a fully functional IT Support Copilot integrated with Freshdesk that can handle dozens of common support requests, reducing your helpdesk workload and providing 24/7 automated assistance.
