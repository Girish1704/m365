# Exercise 5: Empower Team Collaboration and Content Creation with Copilot Pages

## Estimated Duration: 45 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you will explore Microsoft 365 Copilot Pages, a powerful feature that enables real-time collaborative content creation with AI assistance. Copilot Pages transforms your Copilot conversations into dynamic, shareable workspaces where teams can collaborate on AI-generated content, refine ideas together, and create polished deliverables.

Unlike traditional chat interactions that are personal and ephemeral, Copilot Pages persist and can be shared with colleagues for collaborative editing, making them ideal for team projects and content development.

## Exercise Objectives

- Task 1: Introduction to Copilot Pages
- Task 2: Create a Copilot Page from a conversation

   ```

   ![](./media/ex5-raci-matrix.png)

1. Add executive-ready summary:
